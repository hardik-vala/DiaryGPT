Design a logo for a journaling application, featuring a classic moleskin diary prominently in the center. The diary should be open, displaying a stylized representation of a chat bubble, representing an interactive GPT feature that assists users in journaling. The logo should convey a sense of personal growth and introspection, blending the old with the new. The color scheme should be warm and inviting, with earth tones and subtle hints of technology-inspired blues or greens. The overall look should be clean, zen, yet impactful, appealing to users who appreciate both the traditional art of journaling and the convenience of modern technology.
